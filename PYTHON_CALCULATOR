Here is a calculator created to do basic math functions:

#Create four basic mathematical functions: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide' 
# that take in two numbers and return the result of the operation.
def add(x, y):
    return(x + y)
def subtract(x, y):
    return(x - y)
def multiply(x, y):
    return(x * y)
def divide(x, y):
    return(x / y)


#Create a dictionary 'operations' that assigns the functions to their corresponding operation symbols.
symbols = {
    'add': '+',
    'subtract': '-',
    'multiply': '*',
    'divide': '/'
}
operations = {
    'add': lambda x, y: x + y,
    'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,
    'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,
    'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else 'Error: Division by zero'
}



#Create a function 'calculator' that prompts the user to input the first number.
calculator = operations['add'](5, 3)
print(calculator)  # Output will be 8

calculator = operations['subtract'](15, 2)
print(calculator)  # Output will be 13

calculator = operations['multiply'](5, 2)
print(calculator)  # Output will be 10

calculator = operations['divide'](10, 2)
print(calculator)  # Output will be 5.0



#Use a for loop to print the available operation symbols.
for i in operations: 
    print(i) 


#Create a while loop that will continue to run until the user chooses to end the current calculation.
#Inside the while loop, prompt the user to select an operation symbol.
#Prompt the user to input the second number.
#Use the dictionary to retrieve the function that corresponds to the selected operation symbol and store it in a variable 'calculation_function'
#Perform the calculation by calling the 'calculation_function' on the two input numbers and store the result in a variable 'answer'.
#Print the equation and the result of the calculation.
#Ask the user if they would like to continue using the result as the first number for further calculations.
#If the user chooses to continue, update the 'num1' variable to the value of 'answer'.
#If the user chooses to start a new calculation, set the 'should_continue' variable to false and call the 'calculator' function to start a new calculation.
def calculator():
    while True:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

        should_continue = True
        while should_continue:
            print("Available operations: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/)")
            operation_symbol = input("Select an operation symbol: ")

            if operation_symbol not in operations.keys():
                print("Invalid operation! Please choose a valid operation.")
                continue

            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

            calculation_function = operations[operation_symbol]
            answer = calculation_function(num1, num2)
            print(f"{num1} {operation_symbol} {num2} = {answer}")

            should_continue = input("Would you like to continue using the result as the first number? (yes/no): ").lower() == 'yes'
            if should_continue:
                num1 = answer
            else:
                break
